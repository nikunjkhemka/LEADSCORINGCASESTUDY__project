 Although lead scoring is an essential component of lead management, there is a lack of a
 comprehensive literature review and a classifcation framework dedicated to it. Lead scoring is an
 efective and efcient way of measuring the quality of leads. In addition, as a critical Information
 Technology tool, a proper lead scoring model acts as an alleviator to weaken the conficts
 between sales and marketing functions. Yet, little is known regarding lead scoring models and
 their impact on sales performance. Lead scoring models are commonly categorized into two
 classes: traditional and predictive. While the former primarily relies on the experience and
 knowledge of salespeople and marketers, the latter utilizes data mining models and machine
 learning algorithms to support the scoring process. This study aims to review and analyze the
 existing literature on lead scoring models and their impact on sales performance. A systematic
 literature review was conducted to examine lead scoring models. A total of 44 studies have met
 the criteria and were included for analysis. Fourteen metrics were identifed to measure the
 impact of lead scoring models on sales performance. With the increased use of data mining and
 machine learning techniques in the fourth industrial revolution, predictive lead scoring models
 are expected to replace traditional lead scoring models as they positively impact sales
 performance. Despite the relative cost of implementing and maintaining predictive lead scoring
 models, it is still benefcial to supersede traditional lead scoring models, given the higher
 efectiveness and efciency of predictive lead scoring models. This study reveals that classifcation
 is the most popular data mining model, while decision tree and logistic regression are the most
 applied algorithms among all the predictive lead scoring models. This study contributes by
 systematizing and recommending which machine learning method (i.e., supervised and/or
 unsupervised) shall be used to build predictive lead scoring models based on the integrity of
 diferent types of data sources.Additionally, this study ofers both theoretical and practical
 research directions in the lead scoring feld
